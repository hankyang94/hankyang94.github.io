I am an Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering in the [School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/) (SEAS) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/). I obtained my Ph.D. in Robotics from the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://mit.edu/), where I was fortunate to work with [Luca Carlone](https://lucacarlone.mit.edu/) in the [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu/). 

<!-- I am currently a research scientist in the [NVIDIA Autonomous Vehicle Research Group](https://nvr-avg.github.io/) led by [Marco Pavone](https://web.stanford.edu/~pavone/).  -->

<!-- <span style="color:red">We have research intern positions all year at NVIDIA Autonomous Vehicle Research. If you are a PhD student interested in developing safety assurances and robustness guarantees for perception systems, or in general vehicle autonomy, feel free to contact me or other research scientists in the group.</span> -->

I direct the **Computational Robotics Lab** at Harvard University. My group studies the algorithmic foundations of robot perception, action, and learning. We are broadly interested in estimation and decision-making with performance gurantees. 

<!-- the **algorithmic foundations** of robot perception, action, and learning. Our vision is to enable **safe and trustworthy autonomy** for a broad range of high-integrity robotics applications, by designing **tractable and provably correct algorithms** that enjoy rigorous performance guarantees, developing **fast implementations**, and validating them on **real robotic systems**. -->

**Current Interests**: I am currently interested in three challenges. 
- Trustworthy robot perception with learned modules
- Perception-based planning and control with performance guarantees
- Convex optimization for estimation, decision-making, and learning 

<!-- Read more about some of these topics in the sample [research statement](https://hankyang94.github.io/assets/pdf/Research_Statement_Generic.pdf) (November 2021). -->

**Prospective Students**: For PhD opportunities, please apply to the PhD program at Harvard SEAS (*e.g.*, in [EE](https://seas.harvard.edu/electrical-engineering/graduate-programs/how-apply)/[CS](https://seas.harvard.edu/computer-science/graduate-programs/how-apply)/[AM](https://seas.harvard.edu/applied-mathematics/graduate-program/how-apply)/[ME](https://seas.harvard.edu/materials-science-mechanical-engineering/graduate-program/how-apply)) and list me as a potential advisor. I am also open to taking (undergraduate or graduate) research interns.

<!-- **Postdoc Fellow**: We have open Postdoc Fellow positions in Learning, Optimization, Control, and/or Robotics. Please apply [here](https://academicpositions.harvard.edu/postings/12212). -->

I am interested in working with self-motivated candidates with (a) a strong theoretical and computational background (*e.g.*, applied math, optimization and control, statistics, machine learning, and scientific computing), and/or (b) rich experiences in real robotic platforms (*e.g.*, drones, manipulators, ground vehicles).

Due to the large volume of inquiries, I may not be able to reply to all emails, and I apologize for this.
