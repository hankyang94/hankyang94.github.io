I am an Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering in the [School of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://www.seas.harvard.edu/) (SEAS) at [Harvard University](https://www.harvard.edu/). 

I direct the [Computational Robotics Group](https://computationalrobotics.seas.harvard.edu/) at Harvard University. My group is broadly interested in the intersection of theory and practice, particularly computational algorithms that are robust, efficient, offer strong performance guarantees, and supercharge the next generation of intelligent systems.

I obtained my Ph.D. in Robotics from the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology](https://mit.edu/), where I was fortunate to work with [Luca Carlone](https://lucacarlone.mit.edu/) in the [Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems](https://lids.mit.edu/). 

I am also a part-time research scientist at [NVIDIA Research](https://research.nvidia.com/labs/avg/#about).

<!-- I am currently a research scientist in the [NVIDIA Autonomous Vehicle Research Group](https://nvr-avg.github.io/) led by [Marco Pavone](https://web.stanford.edu/~pavone/).  -->

<!-- <span style="color:red">We have research intern positions all year at NVIDIA Autonomous Vehicle Research. If you are a PhD student interested in developing safety assurances and robustness guarantees for perception systems, or in general vehicle autonomy, feel free to contact me or other research scientists in the group.</span> -->



<!-- the **algorithmic foundations** of robot perception, action, and learning. Our vision is to enable **safe and trustworthy autonomy** for a broad range of high-integrity robotics applications, by designing **tractable and provably correct algorithms** that enjoy rigorous performance guarantees, developing **fast implementations**, and validating them on **real robotic systems**. -->

<!-- **Current Interests**: I am currently interested in three challenges. 
- Trustworthy robot perception with learned modules
- Perception-based planning and control with performance guarantees
- Convex optimization for estimation, decision-making, and learning  -->

<!-- Read more about some of these topics in the sample [research statement](https://hankyang94.github.io/assets/pdf/Research_Statement_Generic.pdf) (November 2021). -->

<!-- **Prospective Students**: see this [page](https://computationalrobotics.seas.harvard.edu/joining). -->

<!-- **Postdoc Fellow**: We have open Postdoc Fellow positions in Learning, Optimization, Control, and/or Robotics. Please apply [here](https://academicpositions.harvard.edu/postings/12212). -->

<!-- I am interested in working with self-motivated candidates with (a) a strong theoretical and computational background (*e.g.*, applied math, optimization and control, statistics, machine learning, and scientific computing), and/or (b) rich experiences in real robotic platforms (*e.g.*, drones, manipulators, ground vehicles).

Due to the large volume of inquiries, I may not be able to reply to all emails, and I apologize for this. -->
